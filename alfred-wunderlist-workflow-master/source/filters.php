	@header     Alfred Script Filters
	@abstract   Provides filters that take input directly from Alfred for 
	            the purpose of filtering lists or selecting options.
	@discussion In order to use a handler within Alfred, simply call the
	            script with two arguments: the name of the filter to call
	            and the user's query.

	            See the following example for using a bash script to run a 
	            filter. Note that backquotes, double quotes, backslashes,
	            and dollar signs should be escaped when providing input
	            this way. Excess escaping can cause problems handling simple 
	            characters such as spaces.
				<pre><code>    /usr/bin/env php "`pwd`/filters.php" filterListsToAddTask "{query}"</code></pre>

				Why PHP? This is a [likely temporary] solution to slow 
				feedback from applescript for list filtering. It was found
				that a simple Hello World script took 90ms to run with
				osascript, making AppleScript unsuitable for live filtering.
				Simple script language alternatives such as Python and PHP
				were put through similar tests. By far Perl was the fastest.
				However, in order to be useful the language must have an 
				Alfred workflow library and load it efficiently. Perl did not
				and Python's two options were both shockingly slow. This left
				PHP which was capable of 60ms response times once the logic
				was fully implemented. 

				Unfortunately, PHP and AppleScript do not play well together
				when it comes to platform specifics such as localization. 
				This script will likely be replaced with a compiled Cocoa 
				utility that combines speed and platform suitability.

/*!
	@abstract   A Script Filter input that shows the user's lists in Alfred, allowing
	a task to be added to a specific list.
	@discussion Queries the Wunderlist UI to provide all of the lists into which
	new tasks can be added. The response is formatted for Alfred to display in
	a way that allows the user to type their task, then action a specific list to
	insert the task there.

	After selecting one of these options, the final query will be a concatenation 
	of the list index and the user's task in a format suitable for 
	@link addTaskToList @/link:
	<pre><code>    5::2% milk</code></pre>

	The user may also select a list by autocompletion or substring matching. If the
	query text is a substring of any of the list names, the lists will be filtered
	to show only those that match. The user can action a list item to autocomplete 
	the list name in the following format:
	<pre><code>    Groceries:2% milk</code></pre>

	Alternatively, the user can type a colon character indicating that the task is
	to be entered in the first task matching that substring. The match is case 
	insensitive but is sensitive to accents and other diacritical marks.
	<pre><code>    gro:2% milk</code></pre>
	@param query The text of the task, optionally specified with a substring of a 
	list name followed by a colon to designate the list into which the task should
	be added.
